## Bandit Level 9 → Level 10

Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

1. **Connect to Bandit Server**:
   ```bash
   ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Use the password obtained from Level 8.

2. **Extract Human-Readable Strings**:
   Use the `strings` command to display readable text from a binary file. Combine it with `grep` to search for strings containing `=` characters:
   ```bash
   strings data.txt | grep '===='
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   }========== the
   3JprD========== passwordi
   ~fDV3========== is
   D9========== FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
   ```

3. **Identify the Password**:
   The password is the string immediately following the last `=` sequence:
   ```
   FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
   ```

4. **Log in to the Next Level**:
   ```bash
   ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
